# Active-Model-H
AMH is simulated using Pseudo-spectral method 

The equations of motion for Active Model H are:

$$
\dot\phi = -\nabla\cdot(J+J^\Lambda)
$$

$J^\Lambda$ is the current arising from 'Thermal Noise'

J is the current arising from Stresses (forces) created in the fluid due to concentration gradients in different kinds of substances that make up the fluid.
